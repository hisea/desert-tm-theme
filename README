This is a textmate or sublime text colour scheme for desert.

Based the colours on this stylesheet:
http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/source/browse/trunk/styles/desert.css?r=198

Been hard to find a scheme with the correct colours so I kinda tried to tighten up another version.

The main code a based the colours off is when using HTML and CSS.
Feel free to fork off this to style other code languages.
